          <h1>Bodie: The Proto-Tiny Home</h1>
          <p>
            This house sits in the ghost town of Bodie, California, which was completely abandoned in the early 1900s. The building is tiny, but it's a fair bit longer than wide, enough to be a decently comfortable size. I'm sure this would appeal to tiny-home-loving millenials, but Bodie was definitely not a good place to live when it was occupied.

          <p>
            I'm not sure when the brick building dates from, but, again, it would have to be before around 1915. There are only a few multi-story buildings in the town, and these are two of them. Directly behind the camera is the visitors' center, and in front of it is almost nothing but hills and distant mountains.

          <p>
            Later on in the visit to Bodie, as usually happens in the Sierra Nevada around 2:00-4:00 PM, massive stormclouds began to sweep over the sky. That's the main thing I tried to capture in this picture and the next, though I also thought the random minecart in the grass looked pretty interesting.

          <h1>Bodie: Very Cool Real Estate</h1>
          <p>
            Bodie itself is in the Bodie Hills (surprise!), closer to the Nevada border than the Sierra Nevada. It's still very high up, but its location means you can get some very cool views of the Eastern Sierra. Whoever lived in this house must've had some very cool evenings seeing the sun set over the mountains.

          <h1>Cattle Trough</h1>
          <p>
            I found this trough and another semi-abandoned in a sagebrush meadow on the far west side of the Owens Valley. There was a mechanism that fed more water into the trough whenever any was taken out, but it was faulty, which is why there's water leaking in from the pipe above. The water itself was the color of rust. Though I didn't photograph it, I found a cow vertebra about twenty feet away on the ground.

          <p>
            This photo was all I took on a very fun backpacking trip in Big Sur with a small club from school. Unfortunately, I didn't capture much of the valley and river below us, but the holes in this redwood were apparently interesting enough for me to get my camera out of my pack during a short break. To be fair, it is a pretty cool looking tree.
