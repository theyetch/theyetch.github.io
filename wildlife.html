        <h1>Fawn Encounter: Observation</h1>
        <p>
          This very beautiful fawn came over a dune after its mom and sibling, which by this point were waiting for it about twenty feet away, in the divot before the next dune. Both fawns were pretty curious, but this one stayed for an extra couple of seconds to check things out.

        <p>
          Here's the same fawn as before, this time looking out in the direction of its family before heading off down the dune. All three deer were curious, as mentioned before, and not anxious, but clearly wild. The area is pretty rural, so it was nice to see wildlife that isn't tame.

        <h1>Snowy Egret Hairdos: The Mop</h1>
        <p>
          This is the first in a series of pictures displaying the lovely styles of Southern California's Snowy Egret community. This particularly striking individual has chosen to do his hair up (or down) in a very sexy mop. Of course, style doesn't stop at the head. Knowing this, the subject has chosen to extend the mop all the way down its body, with a tasteful puff of feathers at the back. The whole thing makes it impossible to spot predators, but that's secondary.

        <p>
          Please enjoy the second in the series, where another very handsome egret has gone with a different stylist and come out with a confident hairdo of puffed-out feathers. The ladies are sure to love this. It looks much less emo than the previous bird, and projects extroversion and sociability. Furthermore, the hairdo combines form and function, as our model will be able to spot predators (unlike his competitor).

        <h1>Snowy Egret Hairdos: The Narcissist</h1>
        <p>
          Do all potential mates seem disinterested, displeased, and disgusted? Fear not, my egret friend! With the power of reflection, you'll be able to admire yourself more than anyone else will. Simply stare into the water, like so, and bask in the glory of your own beauty. Any Ancient Greek cautionary tales about egotism can be safely ignored because you, being a bird, cannot read.

        <h1>Snowy Egret Hairdos: Jealousy</h1>
        <p>
          Here is the dark side of the egret fashion industry. These models, which displayed the rival mop and afro hairdos earlier in the series, have gotten into a fierce battle over whose style is better. The fact that none of them have managed to attract any partners is irrelevant, as discussed previously. Interestingly, the same behavior can be found in the human manosphere, but close observation of this is not recommended.

        <h1>Snowy Egret Hairdos: Lunch Break</h1>
        <p>
          Some men are content with food. This is one of those men. Unbothered by the intense rivalries of style and fashion, this calm individual has found a spot far from the fighting and set his mind on fishing. Of course, this is a much more successful strategy, and his calmness has resulted in the acquisition of a topsmelt silverside, which looks very surprised to be in midair.

        <p>
          I was lucky enough to get a picture of this kingbird while it was close to the trail and without startling it. It's especially impressive that it was willing to sit so close on a Sunday, when arguably too many dog and toddler owners were walking along the path. Predictably, I didn't see any other small birds for the rest of the walk, but I'm sure they came back in the hundreds as soon as Monday rolled around and the dog walkers dispersed.

          These cliff swallows were only two of many many more roosting under a bridge along the Owens River. The rest were flying low over the water, then up above the bridge, intermittently stopping into their nests. They acted a lot like fish in a school. The swallow on the left doesn't look too pleased to be intruded on.

        <p>
          This wren was tough to capture. Every time I'd get a little bit closer, it would notice me, hop onto the next prominent bit of sagebrush, and sit there pretending to look away. I finally got it flying off of a sage bush, though with too low a shutter speed (notice the blur) and too much cropping required. I'll get my revenge soon enough.

          This is a better look at what rafting looks like without the intrusion of a Multi-Ton Speeding Thing. A number of sea lions are hauled out on the buoy, but more have been relegated to the raft to its left. On the upper levels of the buoy, some Brandt's cormorants are chilling out as well.

          These California sea lions were displaying rafting behavior, which allows them to conserve energy and rest without hauling out when space is limited. Unfortunately, the boat passing by scared them out of their rest. They don't look too happy about it.
